			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> It was hard to balance its visual prominence with overall design aesthetic.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was difficult to fix the size of the image, but 
						I eventually figured it out by changing the width and
						the height multiple times. I also had a hard time adding the links onto my HTML file 
						it was because I didn't add the correct file name. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I really enjoyed doing this assignment now I have a better idea of how links work 
						and how to organize my files. </p>
			</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results of this lab turned out very well, and I was able to navigate the files smoothly. </p>
