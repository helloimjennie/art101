Task 2 Outline: Rock-Paper-Scissors 
1. Players face each other and usually count to three aloud. 
Common chants include "Rock, Paper, Scissors" or "One, Two, Three, Shoot"
2. Determining the Winner: 
The winner is detemined based on the rules of which gestures defeat the others:
Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins), Scissors cut Paper (Scissors win), 
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
If both players choose the same gesture, the game is a tie, and no one wins that 
round. Players typically play around round to break the tie.
3. Gameplay Duration: 
Before starting, players can agree on the number of rounds to play, such as 
best of three or best of five. The player who wins the most rounds is the overall
winner of the game. 
4. Fair Play: 
Players must form their gestures at the exact same time to ensure fairness. Delayed
reveals or changing gestures mid-reveal are considered cheating.
