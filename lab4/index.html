					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is trying to figure out how to how to organize
						everything into a list and trying to effectively translate real-world logic 
						into a format that is easily understood by others.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had some issues of formatting the indents in the index.html file so 
						it would look presentable on the webpage. We were able to fix it by checking our
						webpage and refreshing the browser so it looks aesthetically pleasing. 
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went smoothly and it was fairly easy to do. After doing this lab,
						I realized how important Pseudocode is because it serves as a bridge between
						problem-solving and actually coding. I feel like it helps in planning and designing
						algorithims while facilicating communucation with other team members. </p>

Task 2 Outline: Rock-Paper-Scissors 

1. Players face each other and usually count to three aloud. 
Common chants include "Rock, Paper, Scissors" or "One, Two, Three, Shoot"
2. Determining the Winner: 
The winner is detemined based on the rules of which gestures defeat the others:
Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins), Scissors cut Paper (Scissors win), 
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
If both players choose the same gesture, the game is a tie, and no one wins that 
round. Players typically play around round to break the tie.
3. Gameplay Duration: 
Before starting, players can agree on the number of rounds to play, such as 
best of three or best of five. The player who wins the most rounds is the overall
winner of the game. 
4. Fair Play: 
Players must form their gestures at the exact same time to ensure fairness. Delayed
reveals or changing gestures mid-reveal are considered cheating.
