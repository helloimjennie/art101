                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge was trying to find out the reason why my code wasn't working. It was difficult for me
                    and my partner and we had to search up videos on how to do it.</p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We ran into minor issues like the search bar wasn't showing up or we weren't able to type anything in
                    it for it to show results.</p>
                <div id="problems"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>However, we ended up making everything work out in the end but it was really difficult to debug this
                    code. </p>

                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>Debugging this code was probably the most frustrating part about this assignment. We weren't able to
                    get it work the first time, and for some reason we
                    spent so much time figuring out what was the reason behind the issue.
