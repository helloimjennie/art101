                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge was trying to find out the reason why my code wasn't working. It was difficult for me
                    and my partner and we had to search up videos on how to do it.</p>
                <div id="challenge"></div>
            </div>


            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We ran into minor issues like the javascript wasn't showing up or we weren't able to type anything in
                    it for it to show results.</p>
                <div id="problems"></div>
            </div>


            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>However, we ended up making everything work out in the end but it was really difficult to debug this
                    code. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>Debugging this code was probably the most frustrating part about this assignment. First, I carefully
                    reviewed the code to identify syntax errors or potential issues. The array “my transport” is
                    declared with “const” to ensure it’s not accidentally reassigned, adhering to best practices in
                    Javascript. I also used ‘transport. join(‘,’) to format the array as a comma-separated list for
                    better readability in the output. I also corrected the HTML line break. After reviewing the
                    Object Definition the ‘myMainRide’ object was correctly defined, and the ‘age’ method correctly
                    calculates the car’s age.
