            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p> The challenge is making sure that there weren't any errors in the codes. Writing the functions down correctly 
             and making sure that everything is in place.

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>For this lab assignment, I had an issue with adding the code because it wouldn't show up on the main webpage.
                I also had an issue with linking the css and javascript file onto the index.html.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>After doing this lab assignment, I was able to learn how to experiment with the console and
                learned more about anonymous functions. </p>
