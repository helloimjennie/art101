				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge was trying to find out the reason why my code wasn't working. It was difficult for me
					and my partner and we had to search up videos on how to do it.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We ran into minor issues like the javascript wasn't showing up or we weren't able to type anything in
					it for it to show results.</p>
				<div id="problems"></div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>However, we ended up making everything work out in the end but it was really difficult to debug this
					code. </p>
